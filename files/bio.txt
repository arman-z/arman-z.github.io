BIOGRAPHY

Arman Zharmagambetov is a Research Scientist in the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team at Meta. 
His research primarily focuses on machine learning and optimization, recently exploring their 
application in enhancing the security and robustness of AI models. His areas of interest include 
adversarial attacks and defenses, prompt injections, and the privacy risks associated with AI systems. 
Prior to this, he did his postdoc with Yuandong Tian at FAIR, focusing on AI-guided design and 
optimization. Arman obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Merced in 2022 where he 
primarily worked on learning algorithms for decision trees and tree-based models, with applications 
in domains like (semi-)supervised learning, neural net compression, dimensionality reduction, and 
model interpretability. Arman is a recipient of various awards, including the UCM Chancellorâ€™s 
Graduate Fellowship and Outstanding Teaching Award. His contributions have been featured in esteemed 
venues, including NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, EMNLP, ICASSP, and more.
